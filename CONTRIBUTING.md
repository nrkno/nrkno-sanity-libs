# Contributing to NRK.no Sanity libraries

This repo exists to showcase some Sanity features implemented at NRK.
It is a resource for learning, 
rather than an arena for building an opensource community.

The libraries are provided "as-is". 
If you choose to use any of these libraries, no support should be expected.

**Pull requests and issues will not be reviewed** 
unless there exists a prior agreement with NRK to do so.

However, feel free to fork this repository and/or use it according to the
[LICENSE](./LICENSE).
